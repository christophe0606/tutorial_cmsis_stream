CMSIS Stream examples that can be tested on Windows / Linux / Mac.

You must first install the cmsis-stream python package:

```python
pip install cmsis-stream
```

Then, uncomment the example you want to build in the `CMakeLists.txt`
(Only one example at same time can be enabled)

Build and run.

Look at the Python script `create.py` and C++ `AppNodes.hpp` file in each example folder for more explanations.
